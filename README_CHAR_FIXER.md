# Finnish Character Fixer

Scripts to fix common encoding issues with Finnish characters (Ã¤Ã¶Ã¥) in text files.

## Problem

When text files with Finnish characters are saved with incorrect encoding, you may see:
- `Ã¤` appears as `ÃƒÂ¤`
- `Ã¶` appears as `ÃƒÂ¶`
- `Ã¥` appears as `ÃƒÂ¥`
- `Ã„` appears as `Ãƒâ€ž`
- `Ã–` appears as `Ãƒâ€“`
- `Ã…` appears as `Ãƒâ€¦`

## Scripts

### 1. `fix_finnish_chars.py` (Python Script)

Main script that does the character fixing.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 fix_finnish_chars.py <input_file> [output_file]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Fix file in place (creates backup)
python3 fix_finnish_chars.py sanat.txt

# Fix to a new file
python3 fix_finnish_chars.py sanat.txt sanat_fixed.txt
```

**Features:**
- Automatically detects and counts encoding issues
- Creates backup when fixing in place
- Reports number of fixes made
- Verifies that all issues were resolved

### 2. `fix_chars.sh` (Bash Wrapper)

Simple wrapper script for easier usage.

**Usage:**
```bash
./fix_chars.sh <input_file> [output_file]
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Text file with Finnish encoding issues

## Safety

- When fixing in place, the script automatically creates a `.backup` file
- The script verifies all fixes were applied correctly
- Read-only operation first to count issues before making changes
